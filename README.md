### Project Track 
Machine Learning, Hardware and Desktop Application .

### Brief Introduction of the Project:
   Lithium-ion batteries are utilized as the leading energy storage source for  many fields , Due to their excellent properties Therefore, knowledge of the present battery health status (State of Health) is compulsory  to ensure the battery reliability and safety. We will predict a reliable State of Health (SOH) estimation using machine learning Algorithm and Dataset battery test bench (Hardware)
      
      
      
### Project Objectives:
   The objective of this project is to design and develop SW / HW system that predicts the State of Health (SOH) of lithium-ion battery and also ensure battery performance, reliability and safety.
